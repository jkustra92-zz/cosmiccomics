### Description

A comic book inventory application that allows users to access the Marvel Comics database and add books to their personal collections.

### Tech used
- Node.js / Express
- MongoDB
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Features
- The use of cookies allows for an individualized user experience.
- Search form that hooks up directly to the API.
- A unique copy of the comic is stored to the database and accessed by ID numbers in the user's object, allowing users to edit
  properties about their comic (if they wish to) without affecting other users.
- Statistics regarding the total cost and page count of the user's comic book collection.

### Future Implementations
- More statistics about the user's collection, such as most common character by percent.
